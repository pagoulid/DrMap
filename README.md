 Features:
        
        Implementing Google maps on DrMap main page
        Visualising markers on map due to coordinates(latitude,longitude) of each doctor location (Each marker has the id of its doctor respectively)
        Center relocation of map according to coordinates of doctor's location with id = 1
        On marker click , displaying further information about doctor
        Added custom zoom in/out(Left click/Right click on map) 
        
                    NOTE : To display information click marker to select,then click again
                    NOTE : It is preferable to use the custom implementation of zoom , and not the zoom buttons provided by Google API , 
                            to avoid bugs with the display
